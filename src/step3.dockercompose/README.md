# Step 3 - Docker-Compose

Making it actually work in docker.

In [step 1](../step1.normal/README.md), we created a classic 3 tier application: front end in ASP.Net Core MVC, a back end in ASP.Net Core Web Api and a Sql Database project.  In [step 2](../step2.docker/README.md), we dockerized our 3 tier app, so instead of running the apps in it's normal environment (kestrel or IIS Express), the apps will run in a Docker container.  The problem we quickly found out is that inter container communication is not easy.  In step 3, docker-compose will bridge the gap of inter container communication.
